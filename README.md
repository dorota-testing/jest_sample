# Sample Jest testing (unit testing for javascript)

This repository contains example of unit testing for javascript. 

### Requirements

To run these tests you will need to have Node.js installed on your computer. Follow this link and click on the green button to install for Mac, Windows or Linux: https://nodejs.org/en/download/ 

A download will start. When a pop-up appears please follow the installation instructions. 

To check you have installed Node.js correctly, go to your terminal and type:

    node --version

Your terminal should respond with the version of Node you have installed. It will look something similar to the following (don't worry if it's not the exact same version): 

    v14.5.0

Once you've got Node installed you can make a start.

### Working with this code

Firstly you will need to [fork this GitHub repository](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) to your own GitHub profile and then clone your forked repository down to your laptop.

Once you have cloned your repository you can proceed to install the dependencies by navigating into the directory (you have cloned) and running:

    yarn install

If you look inside the **functions** directory you will find a file of functions to implement.

To understand how these functions work, take a look in the corresponding test file where the desired functionality is described.

To run the tests, run

    yarn test

You can add your own functions and test.
